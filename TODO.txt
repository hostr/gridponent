When adding a new row to a table, scroll it into view.

The mechanism we're using to populate the model for the read template doesn't work on the initial read.
That's because it gets populated in the change event handler.

Perhaps we should make it easier to obtain a reference to the dataItem by allowing the argument to be any element inside the editor.
The API would call $(elem).closest('[data-uid]').attr('data-uid') to obtain the UID.

Currently it's not possible to pass a url to an event delegate call:
gridponent('#theGrid').rowSelected('http://server/app/controller/action/{{id}}');
Should this be supported?

Can we isolate the controllers commandHandler from the editors? Don't like relying on differences in command value.

What happens if a grid is rendered twice? Make sure the original is disposed if this happens.

Add page size config option (default to 25).
