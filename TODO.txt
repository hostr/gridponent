When updating rows, account for validation errors from the server.
Or handle the beforeUpdate event and validate there. Then cancel the event if validation does not pass.

Implement adding rows. The component can't make any assumptions about the requirements for new records. 
So this should be handled externally. To enable adding records, configure the component with the "create" attribute.
This can be either a url or a function. If it's a url, the component will issue a get request against it, expecting a new record back.
If it's a function, the component will call it with a callback argument.

Ensure we are handling date values correctly. 

Allow the http module to be configured to use JSON or application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

Figure out why fixed headers/footers gets the widths wrong on first render.

Add support for two-way binding using Object.observe: https://github.com/MaxArt2501/object-observe

Refactor using MVC pattern. The controller should handle events, then gather some data from a model, hand it off to a view for rendering, then inject it into the table.
How do we configure the grid for client-side paging? 
If we simply turn paging on, but don't supply a Read property, we'll need a DataSource. In that case we'll assume client-side paging. 
If we supply a Read property, we don't need a DataSource. We'll assume server-side paging.

Test without paging. With both read and datasource.

Add API for CRUD operations.

Add API for search, paging, sorting, etc.

Add support for URL access of sorting, paging, searching, etc.

Add page size config option (default to 25).

Provide an easy way to get at the data via JavaScript.

Might need to re-sync column widths anytime the main table content changes (e.g. deleting or adding rows, paging, sorting).

ChangeMonitor.afterSync should be passed a list of changes. Follow the convention for Object.observe.

Standardize property capitalization.

Rework classes to make it easy to target specific sections of the grid.

Build a jQuery version.

Build a Polymer version.

Create an HtmlWriter class.
