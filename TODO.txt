Should we compile the templates? It might be faster than resolving functions on every call to supplant.
Or we could simply create a dictionary for each template, calling getObjectAtPath on each one.
Create a Template class. Instantiate it with the original string template.
The constructor would compile the template by creating a dictionary of functions for each token.
The Template class would have standard functions for returning data properties, either escaped or raw.
It would first call getObjectAtPath and assign what it finds to the dictionary.
If nothing is found, it would assume it's a property name.

Perform a survey of everything the templating engine needs to do its job.
Convert all templates and helpers into standard functions.
Each function should have a mechanism for declaring what arguments it needs.
Create a templating engine module that is supplied with some grid-specific resources:
- the datamap
- columns
- data
- pageModel
- node
- the current data item
- config object
- the templating engine itself
- etc
The engine uses dependency injection to supply each function with arguments.
Instead of calling the template functions directly, set some properties on the templating engine and call a render function, 
passing in the template name.

Currently it's not possible to pass a url to an event delegate call:
gridponent('#theGrid').rowSelected('http://server/app/controller/action/{{id}}');
Should this be supported?

Return 'this' from as many API functions as possible.

Make sure boolean checkboxes can create an explicit false when creating new records.
This might happen when the model for new records contains no default for a boolean property.

Test to make sure the script initialization method can contain objects and still survive the resolution process.

gp.getType should always return a string type.

Can we isolate the controllers commandHandler from the editors? Don't like relying on differences in command value.

Eliminate setting config.dataItem.

What happens if a grid is rendered twice? Make sure the original is disposed if this happens.

Add page size config option (default to 25).
